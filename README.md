### Two Approaches Available
1. **Collection-based approach** ‚Äì Automatically links products via a collection using smart matching with tags.  
   ‚úÖ Recommended for large stores because it‚Äôs efficient and scalable.  

2. **Product list approach** ‚Äì Links products manually via the **Related Products** metafield.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Works but requires updating each product individually, which can be error-prone.  

All functionality is built into **variant-picker.liquid** file, reusing existing theme styles & functionality instead of reinventing the wheel.  

üëâ During testing, the implementation achieved a **CLS score of 0**, ensuring stable layout and better SEO/accessibility.

## üéÅ Bonuses / Additional Features

- **Swatch Color Metafield**  
  Displays product colors visually using the existing **Swatches** setting in **variant-picker.liquid**.  
  If a product lacks a **"Swatch Color"** metafield, its title is displayed instead.

  Customers can switch options **without page reload**. Controlled via the **Enable smooth product updates** setting, it dynamically refreshes the product section with animation.

## üöÄ 1. Collection-based Approach (Recommended)

This approach uses a product metafield called **Color Products Collection**, which links products via **smart matching with a tag** (e.g., `T-Shirt` for color variations, though any tag can be used).

### To enable for a product:
1. Turn on **Use metafield for colors** setting in **variant-picker** block.  
2. Select **Collection-based approach** in the "Color organization approach" setting   
3. Link the **"Color Products Collection"** metafield on each product to the relevant collection.  

‚úÖ Once set up, all products in the collection are automatically connected, making management simple and automated.

## üîó 2. Product List Approach

This approach uses the **"Related Products"** metafield to manually link products. It gives you **full manual control** over which products should appear as color variations or related options.  

### To enable for a product:
1. Turn on **Use metafield for colors** setting in **variant-picker** block.  
2. Select **Product list approach** in the "Color organization approach" setting 
3. In the **Related Products** metafield, **add the other product pages (for example, different colors) that you want customers to see as options for this product.**  

‚ö†Ô∏è This method works but requires updating each product individually, which can be time-consuming for large stores.  
Best suited for smaller catalogs or when you need precise control.
